Stuff in case it's ok !

This may be an easy way to store/save your game journey on a map.
Choose a map by clicking in the map list menu,
Add a 'points of interest' by clicking on the map.
Update it by changing position, type (npc, mines, flowers, raid entrance, quest items...), name, comments ...
You can delete points of interest if they are no more needed.

Where are datas stored !
Nothing is stored online !
you'll find datas in data.js file
all your datas are stored in your localstorage (F12 then check localstorage)


u can save the web page every where you want on your machine, it's standalone!
that way u may change/replace maps if you need !
(be careful,y our element positions may change if your maps have differents sizes.)

hope it's coming : you will may share your datas by copying and  pasting from the content of the textarea .
right now the code i wrote is just in mess or unreadable, so feel free to contribute ;)

enjoy it !
